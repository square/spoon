Spoon
=====

Distributing instrumentation tests to all your Androids.



Introduction
------------

Android's ever-expanding ecosystem of devices creates a unique challenge to
testing applications. Spoon aims to simplify this task by distributing
instrumentation test execution and displaying the results in a meaningful way.

Instead of attempting to be a new form of testing, Spoon makes existing
instrumentation tests more useful. Using the application APK and instrumentation
APK, Spoon runs the tests on multiple devices simultaneously. Once all tests
have completed a static HTML summary is generated with detailed information
about each device and test.

Spoon will run on all targets which are visible to `adb devices`. Plug in
multiple different phones and tablets, start different configurations of
emulators, or use some combination of both!

The greater diversity of the targets in use, the more useful the output will be
in visualizing your applications.



Screenshots
-----------

In addition to simply running instrumentation tests, Spoon has the ability to
snap screenshots at key points during your tests which are then included in the
output. This allows for visual inspection of test executions across different
devices.

Taking screenshots requires that you include the `spoon-client` JAR in your
instrumentation app. In your tests call the `screenshot` method with a
human-readable tag.

```java
Spoon.screenshot(activity, "initial_state");
/* Normal test code... */
Spoon.screenshot(activity, "after_login");
```

The tag specified will be used to identify and compare screenshots taken across
multiple test runs.

You can also view each test's screenshots as an animated GIF to gauge the actual
sequence of interaction.



Download
--------

Download the [latest runner JAR][1] or the [latest client JAR][2], or grab
via Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.squareup.spoon</groupId>
  <artifactId>spoon-client</artifactId>
  <version>(insert latest version)</version>
</dependency>
```



Execution
---------

Spoon was designed to be run both as a standalone tool or directly as part of
your build system.

You can run Spoon as a standalone tool with your application and instrumentation
APKs.

```
java -jar spoon-runner-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    --apk example-app.apk \
    --test-apk example-tests.apk
```

By default the output will be placed in a spoon-output/ folder of the current
directory. You can control additional parameters of the execution using other
flags.

```
Options:
    --apk               Application APK
    --fail-on-failure   Non-zero exit code on failure
    --output            Output path
    --sdk               Path to Android SDK
    --test-apk          Test application APK
    --title             Execution title
    --class-name        Test class name to run (fully-qualified)
    --method-name       Test method name to run (must also use --class-name)
    --no-animations     Disable animated gif generation
    --size              Only run test methods annotated by testSize (small, medium, large)
    --adb-timeout       Set maximum execution time per test in seconds (10min default)
```

If you are using Maven for compilation, a plugin is provided for easy execution.
Declare the plugin in the `pom.xml` for the instrumentation test module.

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.squareup.spoon</groupId>
  <artifactId>spoon-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>(insert latest version)</version>
</plugin>
```

The plugin will look for an `apk` dependency for the corresponding application.
Typically this is specified in parallel with the `jar` dependency on the
application.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>example-app</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
  <type>jar</type>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>example-app</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
  <type>apk</type>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

You can invoke the plugin by running `mvn spoon:run`. The execution result will
be placed in the `target/spoon-output/` folder.  If you want to specify a test
class to run, add `-Dspoon.test.class=fully.qualified.ClassName`.  If you only
want to run a single test in that class, add `-Dspoon.test.method=testAllTheThings`.

For a working example see the sample application and instrumentation tests in
the `spoon-sample/` folder.
